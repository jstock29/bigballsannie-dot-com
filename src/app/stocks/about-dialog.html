<h1 mat-dialog-title>What is the Stonk Market??</h1>
<div mat-dialog-content>
  <p>
    The Stonk Market is where you can test your luck and try to end up with as much money as your balls will allow. Here you can buy and sell turnips at the market price. Annie runs this market, so there are no fees or commission and she will give you $100 to start. So generous! Then it's up to you and your balls.
  </p>
  <p>
    Trading only lasts 90 seconds, so trade fast! And bring your biggest balls, because every trade is for all of your money or all of your turnips. So if you buy some turnips, you'll buy as many as you have money for at the current price. If you sell turnips, you'll sell all of your turnips at that price. Prices change fast and can move wildly, so buckle up!
