<h1 mat-dialog-title>What is this thing? 🤔🤔</h1>
<div mat-dialog-content>
    <p>Well, this is a monument to our very own Annie Russo of the eponymous Big Balls Annie fame. She loves Animal Crossing, and while I can't build a whole Animal Crossing themed experience, I can build a playground <em>inspired</em> by Annie and her deep, unrelenting love of anthropomorphic animal friends 🐼.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Allie Danneker for excellent photographic contributions. This was built without Annie's knowledge, permission, or consent. I'm not sorry.</p>
    <h3>How things work! 🔧</h3>
    <p>The Stonk Market is a very primitive approximation of a market. Prices change by some random amount every second or so, but are affected slightly by the buy and sell actions of a user.</p>
    <p>The Math Corner is a simple generator that self-checks a random math problem. To make this doable by a human without a calculator, these are limited to values 1-10 and only do addition, subtraction, and multiplication to keep values reasonable.</p>
    <h3>Nerd stuff! 🤓</h3>
    <p>This is a standard Angular 10 app and all computation is done in the browser. Hosted on AWS with Cloudfront and Code Pipelines. The Stonk chart is provided by Highcharts. Our whimsical font is the delightful "Comic Neue" and the favicon is custom designed by me.</p>
