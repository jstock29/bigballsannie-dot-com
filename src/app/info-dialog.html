<h1 mat-dialog-title>What is this thing? 🤔🤔</h1>
<div mat-dialog-content>
    <p>Well, this is a monument to our very own Annie Russo of the eponymous Big Balls Annie fame. She loves Animal Crossing, and while I can't build a whole Animal Crossing themed experience, I can build a playground <em>inspired</em> by Annie and her deep, unrelenting love of anthropomorphic animal friends 🐼.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Allie Danneker for excellent photographic contributions. This was built without Annie's knowledge, permission, or consent. I'm not sorry.</p>
    <h3>How things work! 🔧</h3>
    <p>The Stonk Market is a very primitive approximation of a market. Prices change by some random amount every second or so, but are affected slightly by the buy and sell actions of a user.</p>
    <p>The Math Corner is a simple generator that self-checks a random math problem. To make this doable by a human without a calculator, these are limited to values 1-10 and only do addition, subtraction, and multiplication to keep values reasonable.</p>
    <h3>Nerd stuff! 🤓</h3>
    <p>First, this was designed to be both mobile-first, but also mobile-only, so if you're not using a phone, things look pretty silly! This is a standard Angular 10 app and all computation is done in the browser. Hosted on AWS with Cloudfront and Code Pipelines. The Stonks chart is provided by Highcharts using <del>Highstonks</del> Highstocks. Our whimsical font is the delightful "Comic Neue" and the favicon is custom designed by me.</p>
